Inheritance is one of the most important concepts that exists
in OOP languages, and of course, as always python makes it better and much nicer.

In this repo, I attempt to solve some basic problems using the power of inheritance
along side some awsome test cases. All test cases will be kept seperatly in a folder
called 'test' to keep the directory in a good order
